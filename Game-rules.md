## Game Preparation

1. Shuffle all 60 good cards and put face down forming a draw pile.
2. Deal 3 cards to each player.  These cards are private to that player.
3. Draw 6 cards from the goods card draw pile and create a 2x3 face up into a `marketplace`.  This `marketplace` represents the current demand.
4. Give each player 2 small ship cards, these are face up in front the respective player.
5. Create a common supply. Place all good cubes, coins, workers and separate the special cards into their categories, forming a common supply next to the game board.
6. Place the plots map near the game board.

### Prepare the ships

Prior to game start, each player will now load their ship with 1 cube each.

Cubes are drafted using a snake order.

Choose a First player.   The last player picks first, then drafting proceeds clockwise until the first player picks. The order then reverses (counter-clockwise), starting again with the last player. This continues until each player has two cubes.

Each cube drafted is placed onto a one of their available ship cards. 

> Important rule: Each ship may only ever hold 1 cube.

## Sequence of play

Starting with the First player, and continuing clockwise, each player will become the `active player` and take a turn performing 2 phases in sequence. 

After a player has taken a turn, play continues clockwise from the First player.

## Game play

There are 2 phases, that must be done in sequence.

### Phase 1: Purchase

The active player must choose 1 of the following actions:

- Exchange a goods cube
- Buy 1 special card
- Pass (do nothing)

### Phase 2: Deliver

The active player MUST either:

- Make a Delivery: Play good cards, and trigger coin payouts
- Draw 2 new good cards

Note: A player may not make a delivery and draw 2 goods cards, they must choose.

--

### Exchanging goods cube
A player may exchange the goods cube from ONE of his ships with a different colour, from supply, if its available.

### Buy a special card

The player may spend coins to purchase a single special card, if its available and adds it in front of them (adding it to their tableau /  portfolio).

### Making a delivery: Playing good cards

The player may play any number of good cards of the SAME colour from his hand onto the goods cards in the centre of the table, thus changing the marketplace.

Cards played must overlay existing cards, and the player can never overlay the same card twice in one delivery.   Each card must overlay a different card within the marketplace.

Example: If a player makes a delivery of 2 cards, that player cannot place both cards on top of each other.

#### Triggering payout

When the active player makes a delivery, *all* players get paid out, dependent upon the colour good cubes they have on their ships.

Every player with the same colour goods cube on their ships gets 1 coin per goods cube per goods cards delivered.  

Only the cards delivered count for payout.

For example:

The marketplace has 1 blue card.  Two blue cards are delivered.  This totals 3 blue cards in the marketplace.  All players now get 3 coins per blue goods cube on their ships.

*Tom has 2 blue goods cube, and gets 3x2 = 6 coins, whereas, Sarah has 0 blue goods cube and gets nothing*

### Drawing two new good cards

Instead of making a delivery, the active player may draw two new gods cards to their hand.

*Note: There is a hand limit of 6 cards*

## Special cards

There are 5 special cards:

Ship - Cost: 10 coins
The player may carry one more goods cube. After purchasing the ship, the player takes a good cube and immediately loads it

Office - Cost: 8 coins
Whenever the active player makes a delivery, they will get paid out 2 extra coins per delivery.

Warehouse - Cost: 15 coins
The player permanently increases their hand size, and may now hold 2 extra cards in their hand.

Forklift - Cost: 15 coins
When drawing cards, a player may draw 1 extra

Crane - Cost: 12 coins
In phase 1, the player may exchange an extra goods cube.  This may also be done immediately after purchasing the card.

# Game end

The game ends immediately hen the card draw is exhausted.  The player with the most coins wins.  Special cards purchased during the game do not count towards victory.
